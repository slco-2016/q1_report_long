### Operating hypothesis during user research

**Initial hypothesis:** People are failing to attend their court appearances or comply with supervision requirements because they forget them.

**Revised hypothesis:** Some people are indeed simply forgetting their appointments, but there are other myriad of social, emotional, financial, logistical, and institutional barriers that account for people failing to comply with their supervision. Identifying patterns and producing archetypes will be necessary to provide a foundation upon which to research and measure the target population longitudinally.

### Rationale for the creation of archetypes

*“Identifying archetypes – in the ageless symbols and defining character traits so vital in shaping the human psyche – makes it possible for researchers to investigate attitudes, beliefs, emotions and behaviours in ways that go far beyond traditional qualitative reports.” - David Kay, Research Dimensions*

The notion of archetypes in the field of criminology was solidified by Terrie Moffitt’s dual taxonomy of offending behavior in her 1993 journal article “Adolescence-limited and life-course-persistent antisocial behavior: a developmental taxonomy” (Psychological Review. 100(4):674-701, October 1993). 

In “Scaling archetypal criminals,” Dr. Matt DeLisi designed a 7-item additive scale to analyze early prediction scales that have been designed in order to identify criminogenic behavior (American Journal of Criminal Justice, 26: 77–92.  2001.). The article identifies a tendency for the analyzes predictive models to over-predict criminality. Further, Dr. DeLisi cites Moffitt and “a sizable empirical literature” that “only about 5% of offenders demonstrate the pathological criminality.” Given this conclusion, it becomes critical to analyze and understand populations beyond a criminogenic binary - as current criminal justice methods employ. Rather, it is valid to identify and categorize population according to more holistic attributions.

### Resulting archetypes

1. **Achievement-focused**
	- *“[This is the] the first time in a long time I'm doing good. I’m proud of myself.”*
	- Characteristics:
		- Has positive social support, mild confidence about their success.

		- May have  recreational drug use in their past or are overcoming addiction. 
		- May have multiple convictions in their past or need to move away from negative social ties.

2. **Confused**
	- *“I don’t even know when it was that’s how messed up I was. That’s how lost I was. Everything is a blur.”*
	- Characteristics:
		- Needs reminders and positive social support.
		- Negative social influences can influence their actions.
		- May have to navigate multiple cases at the same time. 
		- Unsure of their success and wants to make sure they are complying with their requirements.
		- May use drugs recreationally, and/or, have trauma in the past they are working through.

3. **Consequence-focused**
	- *“I just got to stop hanging out with certain other people.”*
	- Characteristics:
		- Constant fear failing supervision requirements.
		- Most likely are in their early 20's with some family support.
		- Most likely are able to remember their appointments.
		- Most likely negative social influences can influence their actions.
		- May be clear on what’s expected of them. 

4. **Stable**
	- *“Everything just hit my family at once. This is something I just want to move past.”*
	- Characteristics:
		- Life is relatively organized, financially secure.
		- Perceives their situation as an error in judgement or unlucky circumstances that lead to their arrest but not as indicative of themselves as people.
		- Wants to remedy the situation and put their charge behind them.
		- Most likely supervision fees are difficult for them to pay.

5. **Angry**
	- *“I'm going to fight all those charges. I'm not causing no trouble.”*
	- Characteristics:
		- Blames circumstances as result of being targeted by law enforcement.
