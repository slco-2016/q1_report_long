### Operating hypothesis during user research

**Initial hypothesis:** People are failing to attend their court appearances or comply with supervision requirements because they forget them.

**Revised hypothesis:** Some people are indeed simply forgetting their appointments, but there are other myriad of social, emotional, financial, logistical, and institutional barriers that account for people failing to comply with their supervision.

This impacts the work with are doing to improve a client's ability to communicate with their case manager by allowing us to understand a client’s willingness and ability to comply with the justice system and inform future automated communication that may  help them successfully complete their time under supervision.

### Rationale for the creation of archetypes

*“Identifying archetypes – in the ageless symbols and defining character traits so vital in shaping the human psyche – makes it possible for researchers to investigate attitudes, beliefs, emotions and behaviours in ways that go far beyond traditional qualitative reports.” - David Kay, Research Dimensions*

The notion of archetypes in the field of criminology was solidified by Terrie Moffitt’s dual taxonomy of offending behavior in her 1993 journal article “Adolescence-limited and life-course-persistent antisocial behavior: a developmental taxonomy” (Psychological Review. 100(4):674-701, October 1993). 

In “Scaling archetypal criminals,” Dr. Matt DeLisi designed a 7-item additive scale to analyze early prediction scales that have been designed in order to identify criminogenic behavior (American Journal of Criminal Justice, 26: 77–92.  2001.). The article identifies a tendency for the analyzes predictive models to over-predict criminality. Further, Dr. DeLisi cites Moffitt and “a sizable empirical literature” that “only about 5% of offenders demonstrate the pathological criminality.” Given this conclusion, it becomes critical to analyze and understand populations beyond a criminogenic binary - as current criminal justice methods employ. Rather, it is valid to identify and categorize population according to more holistic attributions.
