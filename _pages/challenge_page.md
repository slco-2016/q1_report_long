##### *“They just get sucked into the system.” - Probation Case Manager, Criminal Justice Services, Salt Lake County*

Complexities in navigating the criminal justice system creates the potential for an individual to become stuck in highly punitive cycles, regardless of any intentions to move beyond incarceration. 61% of jail inmates have prior sentences to probation and 58% of jail inmates have prior sentences to incarceration, according to the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=274).

Ensuring success in Pretrial and Probation services have the potential to keep people from serving jail time over and over. According to the a report by The Council of State Governments Justice Center, 1 out of 3 people on pretrial supervision and 1 out of 2 people on county probation do not fulfill the requirements of their supervision. 
The full report, Salt Lake County, Utah A County Justice and Behavioral Health Systems Improvement Project, can be found [here](https://csgjusticecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SaltLakeCountyReport.pdf).

In Norman Fineman’s “The social construction of noncompliance: a study of health care and social service providers in everyday practice” (Sociology of Health & Illness Volume 13, Issue 3, pages 354–374, 2008), “non-compliance” is divided into two categories:

- **Unwilling** 
	- Manipulative: sabotage, working the system
	- Recalcitrant: rigid, stubborn
- **Unable**
	- Hindered by disabilities: physical, cognitive, chemical dependencies

We seek to create services that assist both clients and case managers to reduce impediments to and create opportunities for success.
